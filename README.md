## Introduction
This repository demonstrates the process of fine-tuning the Microsoft Phi-3 model using the UnSloth framework. Fine-tuning involves adjusting the pre-trained model to better suit specific tasks or datasets. Here, we use the yahma/alpaca-cleaned dataset to refine the performance of Phi-3.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

Python 3.7 or later
Jupyter Notebook
Necessary Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)
Installation
## Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fine-tuning-phi_3-using-unsloth.git
cd fine-tuning-phi_3-using-unsloth
## Install required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Dataset
The dataset used for fine-tuning is yahma/alpaca-cleaned. This dataset has been pre-processed to remove noise and inconsistencies, making it suitable for training and evaluation purposes.

## Fine-Tuning Process
The fine-tuning process is detailed in the Jupyter notebook phi_3_fine_tuning_using_unsloth.ipynb. Follow the steps in the notebook to perform the fine-tuning:

## Load the dataset:
The notebook provides code to load and preprocess the yahma/alpaca-cleaned dataset.
## Configure the model:
Set up the Microsoft Phi-3 model with the appropriate configuration for fine-tuning.
## Training:
The notebook walks through the training process, including setting hyperparameters and running the training loop.
## Evaluation:
After training, the model is evaluated on a validation set to assess its performance.
## Usage
To use the fine-tuned model, you can load it from the saved checkpoint and run inference on new data. Detailed instructions are provided in the notebook.

## Results
The results of the fine-tuning process, including model performance metrics and qualitative analysis, are documented in the final section of the Jupyter notebook.
